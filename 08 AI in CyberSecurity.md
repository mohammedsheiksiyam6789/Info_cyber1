# Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cybersecurity
## Core Concept

### Role of AI/ML in CyberSecurity
- Machine Learning for Intrusion detection and malware analysis
- Predictive analytics for attack prevention
- AI-driven SOC automation (SOAR tools)

### AI Techniques in security
- supervised Learning: Malware classification (Benign vs Malicious)
- Unsupervised learning: Anomaly detection in logs
- Reinforcement learnings: Adaptive response systems

### Applications os AI in Threat Detection
- Email phishing detection using NLP
- Behavior-based endpoint protection
- Network traffic anomaly detection (IDS/IPS enhancement)
- User and Entity Behavior Analysis (UEBA)


### AI-powered Tools & Platforms
- IBM QRadar Advisor with Watson
- Darktrace (AI for network anomaly detection)
- Crowdstrike Falcon (AI endpoint protection )
- cylancePROTECT, Azure Sentinel (ML-based Alerts)

### Limitation & Ethical Challenges
- Adversarial ML (Poisoning data, evasion attacks)
- Privacy  concerns (Training data exposure)
- Explainability issues (AI decision transparency)
