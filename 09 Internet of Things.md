# Internet of Things(IoT) Security
## IoT Architecture Overview

### Layers:
- Preception (sensors, actuators)
- Network (Routers ,Gateway, Protocols)
- Applications (Smart Home, Healthcare, Industrial IoT)
- Communication Protocols: MQTT,CoAP,ZigBee,BLE

### Common IoT Vulnerabilities
- Default or hardcoded credentials (e.g., admin:admin)
- Unencrypted communication
- Weak authentication mechanisms
- Insecure firmware updates
- Lack of device patching
- Exposure of IoT endpoints to the internet (Shodan indexing)

 ### IoT  Attacks (Case Studies)
 - Mirai Botnet (2016): DDos attack using vulnerable IoT devices
 - Ring DoorBell Data Leak: Unencrypted Video Feed
 - Smart Car Hacks: Remote Control Vulnerabilities in connect vehicles

 ## IoT Security Framwork & Standards
 - Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) IoT Top 10
 - IoT Security Foundation (IoTSF) Compliance Framework
 - NISTIR 8259 - Device Cybersecurity Capabilities  
 - ENISA Guidelines For IoT risk management  

### IoT Security Measures
- Network segmentation for IoT devices
- Strong password & certificate based authentication
- Secure firmware OTA updates
- Logging & monitoring of device behavior
